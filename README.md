This repository contains my Personal Data Science Projects

My Personal Projects :
## 1. Adidas and Nike Shoes Classification Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Adidas_and_Nike_Shoes_Classification_Model.ipynb`) that demonstrates a model trained to classify Adidas and Nike shoes. 

You can try out the model on Hugging Face's model hub: [AdidasAndNike](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hilalrd/AdidasAndNike).

## 2. Churn Customer Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Churn_and_Not-Churn_Shoes_Classification_Model.ipynb`) that demonstrates a model trained to classify Churn and Not-Churn customer for customer retention. 

You can try out the model on Hugging Face's model hub: [ChustomerChurn](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hilalrd/CustomerChurn).

## 3. BBCA Closing Price Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`BBCA_Closing_Price_Prediction_Model.ipynb`) that demonstrates a model trained to predict the closing price of BBCA stock for minimize investment losses.

You can try out the model on Hugging Face's model hub: [BBCAClosingPrice](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hilalrd/PrediksiHargaPenutupan).

## 4. Credit Default Payment Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Credit_Default_Classsification_Model.ipynb`) that demonstrates a model trained to classify credit default payment next month.

## 5. Trend Of Banking Stock Movement

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Trend_of_Bangking_Stock_Movement.ipynb`) that analysis and visualization of the current trend of stock movements within the banking sector for investment based on historical data trade.

You can see data visualization on looker studio hub: [Trendofstock](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/2b8ed0b1-ec4e-45ea-be98-53c953d1c7c7)


Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with the model! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
