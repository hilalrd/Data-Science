## 1. Adidas and Nike Shoes Classification Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`1. Adidas_and_Nike_Shoes_Classification_Model.ipynb`) that demonstrates a model trained to classify Adidas and Nike shoes. 

You can try out the model on Hugging Face's model hub: [AdidasAndNike](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hilalrd/AdidasAndNike). 

Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with the model! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
